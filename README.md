User guide
-----------

1. Type your message in the text field

2. Click the "Post" button on your favorite SNS. It will launch the SNS site and fill in the text you have typed. Review and confirm the submission.

3. In case the "Post" button is missing, it means the SNS doesn't support this feature. Instead, you may press the "Copy" button (below the text field) to copy to the clipboard. And then press the "Open" button, it will launch the regular site, and you may paste the text to the site's post message box.
